<h2> Hello 
my name is <STRONG> Oxs,</STRONG><br><br> </h2>
I am currently embarking on a journey to learn web development, I became interested in web development after taking a web development college course.

<br>

<h3> Here is what I'm currently focusing on: </h3>

<ul> 
 <li> Using FreeCodeCamp.com to learn responsive web design, by following the beginner projects. </li>
 <li> Focusing on my mastery of <STRONG> HTML. </STRONG> <br> </li>
 <li> Focusing on my mastery of <STRONG> CSS. </STRONG> </li>
</ul>

<br>

After I feel proficient in these, I will begin to learn JavaScript.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me!

I will update this as I get used to GitHub and my skills increase.
