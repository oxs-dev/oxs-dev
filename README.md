Hello, my name is Oxs and I am currently embarking on a journey to learn web development. I was interested in web development after taking a web development college course.

Here is what I'm currently focusing on:

 I'm using FreeCodeCamp.com to learn responsive web design, by following the beginner projects.

Focusing on my mastery of HTML.
Focusing on my mastery of CSS.

After I feel proficient in these, I will begin to learn JavaScript.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me!

I will update this as I get used to GitHub and my skills increase.
